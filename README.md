## INTRODUCTION
The growing emphasis of health equity has recently become a major priority in the United States and it has contributed to the rising healthcare costs. Leveraging health insurance data to predict future claims costs and identifying key factors that drive these  escalating costs can provide actionable insights to improve decision-making and expense management of health insurance providers.

## PROBLEM STATEMENTS 
<ul>
    <li>Based on an individual’s demographic and lifestyle, can we predict the individual’s health insurance charges accurately?</li>
    <li>Can we classify who would likely incur high health insurance costs?</li>
    <li>What factors strongly influence health insurance costs? </li>
</ul>

## GOALS 
<ul>
    <li>Predict health insurance costs using linear regression (baseline model) based on demographic and lifestyle features and compare with Ridge and Lasso regression (regularized model) - use R-squared, MAE & MSE as evaluation metrics</li>
    <li>Classify the risk level of an individual (high cost vs low cost patient) by setting a specific threshold based on lifestyle features and/or predicted charges using logistic regression</li>
    <li>Determine the most influential feature that affects health insurance cost using GridSearchCV</li>
</ul>


## DATA ACQUISITION
<ul>
    <li>The dataset was taken from Kaggle ➡️ <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/medical-insurance-price-prediction"><strong style="font-size: 16px;">Health Insurance Cost Data</strong></a></li>
    <li>The raw data has 7 features and 2,772 records in total</li>
</ul>
